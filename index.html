          <h3>Project Management</h3>
          <p>
            I have three years of Experience working as project manager, and I
            have managed over 300 project in my career whose budget ranges from
            $10,000 to $50 millions. I have lead or supervised the team members
            to complete maintenance projects or capital improvements projects. I
            have acted as a stack holder on the outside contractors to get a
            work done when the in-house team is overwhelmed by the ongoing
            projects. I was responsible for the planning, designing,
            cost-estimation, creating bid-specifications, budget approval, bid
            advertisement, contract award, inspections, and completion of the
            project.
